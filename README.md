## Description
This project utilizes the powerful combination of Husky and lint-staged to enhance the development workflow and ensure code quality.

## Husky
Husky is a Git hook manager that allows you to easily manage and configure Git hooks in your project. Git hooks are scripts that run automatically at certain points in the Git workflow, such as before committing or pushing code. Husky simplifies the process of setting up and managing Git hooks, making it easier to enforce code quality and enforce team conventions.

## lint-staged
lint-staged is a tool that allows you to run scripts on staged files before committing them. It works in conjunction with Husky to run pre-commit checks on the files that are about to be committed. lint-staged helps ensure that only formatted and linted code gets committed, preventing common mistakes and enforcing code style and quality standards.

## Features
# Pre-commit Hooks
With Husky and lint-staged, you can configure pre-commit hooks to automatically format and lint your code before each commit. This helps catch and fix issues early on, ensuring that the committed code adheres to the established code style and quality guidelines.

# Customizable Configuration
Both Husky and lint-staged provide flexible configuration options. You can define which scripts should be run as part of the pre-commit hook, such as running Prettier to format the staged files or running linters like ESLint or TSLint to catch potential errors or style violations. You have full control over the configuration to meet your project's specific needs.

# Improved Code Quality
By leveraging the power of Husky and lint-staged, you can significantly improve the overall code quality of your project. The automated pre-commit checks help catch common mistakes, enforce coding standards, and ensure a consistent codebase, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.
